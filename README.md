### Description

I am just a beginner myself, and this is my first submission, so don't bother voting for this unless it really helped you. It's just a tutorial (if you will) of how to move multiple items from one listbox to another. Basically, I am a newbie, helping other newbies. Eventually, I plan on making this into a custom control or something that I can use in future applications, but I'm not ready to attack that yet. I tried putting as much comments as I could, so I hope that this helps atleast 1 person.

Note: You'll notice that the code for the Add and Remove procedures are identical, other than the listbox names, so in a real world scenario, you'd probably only have one procedure for both, with 2 parameters, (fromList, toList).
